# ScrcpyGUI - GUI for Scrcpy

A GUI for [Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) that would work as a layer over the original module and be independent of its updates.

Main focus is to get it working for macOS as the other alternatives are either old or do not support macOS.

Current goals:
- Clean and easy to use
- macOS support
